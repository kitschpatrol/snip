## Overview

Snip helps you create, edit, manage, and synchronize code snippets from the command line. Synchronize to (and possibly eventually from) editors like VSCode.

Snip is a fork of [Jared Hanstra](https://github.com/jhanstra)'s [snipster](https://github.com/jhanstra/snipster). Snip includes both some [additions](#background) and some [regressions](#the-future) vs. the original.
