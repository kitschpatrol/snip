## Overview

Snip helps you create, edit, manage, and synchronize code snippets from the command line. Synchronize to (and possibly eventually from) editors like VS Code.

Snip is a fork of [Jared Hanstra](https://github.com/jhanstra)'s [snipster](https://github.com/jhanstra/snipster). Snip includes both some [additions](#background) and some [regressions](#the-future) vs. the original.

## Background

Snip is a fork of [Jared Hanstra](https://github.com/jhanstra)'s [snipster](https://github.com/jhanstra/snipster).

Modifications include:

- A monosyllabic name 😅.
- Migration from JavaScript → TypeScript + Zod.
- Migration from CommonJS → ES Modules.
- Migration from Yarn → PNPM.
- Added `.ignore` file support.
- Added `$EDITOR` support for creating new snippets.
- Added support for `~` in paths.
- Implemented a new automated language ID aggregation approach based on scraping plugin manifests from the VS Code marketplace.
- Added support for snippet descriptions — stored in the snippet file name itself.

## The future

- [ ] Explore Amazon Q (née Fig) auto-complete generation and integration
- [ ] Additional editor adapters
- [ ] Sync-from-editor migration fixes
- [ ] Cosmiconfig
